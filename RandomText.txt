Sometimes, asking the person about who they talk to all the time is not a wise idea. 
You should do it discreetly to ensure that they do not know that you are tracking the person’s location.
Plus, tracking an IP address (e.g. 91.245.223.55) seems the only possible way to unmask the person sending you harassing or threatening texts.
